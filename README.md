# SEAMS 2022 submission 14

## Replication Package

This package contains the raw data as well as scripts used to carry out the empirical evaluation presented in the following research paper:

"Taming Model Uncertainty in Self-adaptive Systems Using
Bayesian Model Averaging"

submitted for publication to the 17th Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS 2022).

Authors:
- Matteo Camilli, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Italy
- Raffaela Mirandola, Politecnico di Milano, Italy
- Patrizia Scandurra, University of Bergamo, Italy


### Getting started

The package contains software and data to replicate the controlled experiments described in the paper. The software is a set of scripts implemented by using `python3` and `R`.

The following `python` libraries are required. Install them by running `pip3 install <library>` (e.g., `pip3 install numpy`):
* `mpmath`
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `statsmodels`
* `geneticalgorithm`
* `sklearn`

The following `R` packages are required. Install them by running `install.packages('<package>')` from a R terminal (e.g., `install.packages('BMA')`):
* `BMA`
* `MASS`
* `BAS`
* `argparse`
* `R.utils`

This package is structured as follows:
* `root` contains the scripts to run the experiments.
* `data/` contains the raw observations generated by using the *oracle model* of the *rescue robot*.
* `logs/` contains raw logs pre-generated by running the scripts as well as clean data files that can be used to draw the plots.
* `plots/` contains `.pdf` plots pre-generated starting from the data in the `logs/` folder.
